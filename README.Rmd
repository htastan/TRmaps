# TRmaps <a href='https://github.com/htastan/TRmaps'><img src='man/img/hex1.png' align="right"  width="200"/></a>



The purpose of this package is to provide data sets to draw maps of Turkey at four levels: 
  - NUTS-Level 1: Broad geographical regions (there are 12)
  - NUTS-Level 2: Geographical sub-regions (there are 26)
  - NUTS-Level 3: Provinces (there are 81 as of 2021, these are also the largest 
  administrative units)
  - District level: there are 973 districts as of 2021 



## Installation

The development version can be installed from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) using
 
```{r eval=FALSE, include=TRUE}
# devtools is required, install if you don't already have it
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("htastan/TRmaps")
```


## Basic Usage 

### NUTS-1


```{r}
library(turkeymaps)
library(tidyverse)
library(sf)
```

```{r}
data("tr_nuts1")
tr_nuts1
```
 

To draw a simple map, run the following code chunk: 
```{r ex1}
ggplot(tr_nuts1) + 
  geom_sf()
```
 
 


```{r ex2}
ggplot(tr_nuts1) + 
  geom_sf(mapping = aes(fill = NUTS1_name))
```

  

### NUTS-2

```{r ex3}
ggplot(tr_nuts2) + 
  geom_sf()
```
  

### NUTS-3

```{r ex4}
ggplot(tr_nuts3) + 
  geom_sf()
```
 
 

### District level

```{r ex5}
ggplot(tr_ilce) + 
  geom_sf()
```
